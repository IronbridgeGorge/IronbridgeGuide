The Iron Bridge gives the local village its name, and was built in 1781 by Abraham Darby III, the grandson of the original Abraham Darby who first step up an iron foundry in the area.

The bridge was the first of its kind, and because of this, it employs some unusual contruction techniques which are borrowed more from carpentry than ironwork, including mortise and tenon and dovetail joints.

The bridge is a listed monument and is closed to traffic.

A tollhouse on the southern side of the bridge used to collect tolls from people using the bridge, but now includes a small museum telling the story of the bridge.

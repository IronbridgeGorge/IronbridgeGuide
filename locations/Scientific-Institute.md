In the area known as Paradise sits this fantastic building. (@vshropshire)[https://twitter.com/vshropshire] notes it was established 1853 by the Coalbrookdale Company as a literary and scientific institute, later a school of art.

The grand iron gates at the bottom of the drive bearing a plaque that states ”that regardless of race, colour, creed, young people can spend a night. It also states that the common purpose is to help all, especially the young of limited means, to a greater knowledge, love and care of the countryside.”

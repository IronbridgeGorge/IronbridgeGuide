This section of rail evokes the railways which criss-crossed the Coalbrookdale ironworking site.

The rail has a flange on it which kept the wagon wheels on the track. Later railways switched to placing the flanges on the wheels instead.

##Do you know...
how long did it take to get from Coalbrookdale to London in the mid 19th century?

Listen to a historian Matthew Ward talks about the transport system in those times.

You can see what is left of the of coke-fired blast furnaces built in the 1750s alongside the River Severn, built by the Madeley Wood Company. The works were taken over by Abraham Darby III of the Coalbrookdale Company in 1776. 

The eye-catching and rather beautiful painting known as "Coalbrookdale at night" by Philip James de Loutherbourg painted in 1801 represents these furnaces in full flow

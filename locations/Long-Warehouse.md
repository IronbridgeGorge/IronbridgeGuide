This warehouse looks like it's elevated on stilts. That is because the Coalbrookdale Company had its own railway and the trains would run beneath the building to make loading easier.

You may notice a number of large objects underneath the building. We know thanks to the excellent work done by the museum team what some of these objects are - ask for the "Large Objects Audit".

Can you help get us some good photos of the following large objects? Ask us a question through the link below and attach your photo with what you think it is.

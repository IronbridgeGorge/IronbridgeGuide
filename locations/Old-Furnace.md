This blast furnace was used by Abraham Darby to successfully use coke to smelt iron ore. In so doing, he paved the way for the mass production of domestic ironware. 

This first image was taken in c. 1960 and shows the lintels of the Old Furnace. The Abraham Darby refers to Abraham Darby III who cast the Iron Bridge.

Listen to Bill Brown (born in 1886) speaking about his job as a worker at a forge. He mentions 'races', which were metal plates between the furnace and the hammer.

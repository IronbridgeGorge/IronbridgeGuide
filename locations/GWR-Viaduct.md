This huge structure is a railway viaduct. It was built between 1862 and 1864 as part of the line between Wellington and Craven Arms. When it was built it was known as the "golden mile", as it the most expensive viaduct ever built in its time. 

The railway was built after the blast furnance was already here, and so they had to very carefully construct the viaduct around the existing buildings â€“ not the othe way round. If you look at the base of the viaduct, you can see how carefully the brickwork jigsaws with the other other buildings.

Like many branch lines, this was closed to passengers in the 1960s. Today the line services the Ironbridge biomass power station, with long trains transporting wood-chip fuel to the site once or twice a day.

## Questions

**What are the white marks on the walls?**

This is calcium carbonate left behind from the water that runs down the viaduct (it has something of a drainage problem). It is really similar to stalagmites you might find in caves.

Look up at this glass-fronted structure. It is the remains of a covered bridge that crossed the road. If you look at the building opposite, you can see from the differently coloured brickwork where this once entered the building.

When the bridge was removed, the remaining section started to lean to one side.

As this is now part of a Listed Building, the leaning, like the Tower of Pisa, will remain forever.

The glass front gives us one advantage â€“ if you stand in the right spot, you can see the reflection of the beautiful clock tower.
